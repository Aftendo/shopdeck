## Overview

Welcome to Shopdeck, the official replacement server for the Nintendo 3DS eShop. Offering an alternative source for accessing digital content, Shopdeck aims to provide a seamless experience for 3DS users. Please note that this project does not cover the Wii U eShop for now.

## Anti-Piracy Statement

Shopdeck unequivocally does not support piracy. We are committed to maintaining ethical standards and urge users to respect intellectual property rights.

## Technology Stack

Shopdeck is crafted with modern Python 3.10 and leverages the power of two web frameworks: Django and Flask. This robust combination ensures optimal performance and scalability.

## Legality and Compliance

Shopdeck operates strictly within legal boundaries. We adhere to stringent policies and ensure that our implementation does not infringe upon Nintendo's proprietary rights. The base tickets used by Shopdeck contain no data about legitimate titles.

## Setup Instructions

For comprehensive setup instructions, please refer to the [Wiki/Development Setup](https://github.com/LetsShop3DS/shopdeck/wiki/Development-Setup) section of this repository.
