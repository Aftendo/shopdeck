## Overview

Welcome to Shopdeck, the official replacement server for the Nintendo 3DS eShop. Offering an alternative source for accessing digital content, Shopdeck aims to provide a seamless experience for 3DS users. Please note that this project does not cover the Wii U eShop.

## Anti-Piracy Statement

Shopdeck unequivocally does not support piracy. We are committed to maintaining ethical standards and urge users to respect intellectual property rights.

## Technology Stack

Shopdeck is crafted with modern Python 3.10 and leverages the power of two web frameworks: Django and Flask. This robust combination ensures optimal performance and scalability.
