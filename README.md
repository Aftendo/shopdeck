The official source code for the replacement server!
# How to setup?
Stuff is not final; and its quite complicated; soooo uuuh~ if you wanna set it up, good luck!

Setting up the actual server is quite simple tho; it's just a combo between Django and Flask. (Flask server is under main.py and Django is under manage.py)
